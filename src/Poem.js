			A rainbow in the sky:
			So was it when my life began;
			So is it now I am a man;
			So be it when I shall grow old,
			Or let me die!
			The Child is father of the Man;
			And I could wish my days to be
			Bound each to each by natural piety.`,

	new Poem(`A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal`, `A slumber did my spirit seal
			I had no human fears:
			She seemed a thing that could not feel
			The touch of earthly years.

			No motion has she now, no force;
			She neither hears nor sees;
			Rolled round in earthâ€™s diurnal course,
			With rocks, and stones, and trees.`,
		`William Wordsworth`,
